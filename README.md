# OpenCrib 🏠✨  
**Host anything. Find your people.**

OpenCrib is an iOS-first platform for anyone who wants to host events, share their space, or bring people together. From house shows and backyard parties to art pop-ups, workshops, or casual meetups, OpenCrib makes it easy to open your door to a community that cares.  

We’re starting with a simple **MVP**: a lightweight way to connect hosts and attendees, discover unique events, and empower organizers of all sizes — no gatekeepers, no massive budgets required.

## 🌟 Core Idea
- **Host Whatever You Want** – Music, art, fitness classes, poetry readings, book clubs — OpenCrib is built for creativity.

- **DIY Community** – Designed for small, independent hosts and people who want genuine, local experiences.  
- **Simple, Mobile-First** – Built natively for iOS in Swift for speed and usability.
